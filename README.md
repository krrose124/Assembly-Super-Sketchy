# Assembly-Super-Sketchy
Compiler for the Assembly Super Sketchy (ASS) language

The compiler is written in Rust with a homemade lexer and parser to see what I am capable of post my compiler design class. Hence the name Assembly for an assembly like language and Super Sketchy for me wanting to make my own lexer and parser.
This is a personal project of mine and the goal is to use this language for the code gen of a higher level language I make in the future.
Eventually I want this readme to contain the spec of the language.
